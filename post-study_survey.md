## Post-Study Survey

This is a test for evaluating your understanding on programming after a short tutorial, either in LOGO or PiE-LOGO. We will only use it for this user study and later research purpose. Please answer every question honestly and patiently. Thank you!

A. 3
B. 9
C. 6
D. 2

7. In this program, what happend?

clear the screen
Repeat the following for 4 times:
  Go forward 150 steps
  turn right
end the repeat

A. A square is drawn
B. A rectangle is drawn
C. A star is drawn
D. A diamond is drawn
E. I'm not sure
```

```
8. In this program, what happend?

clear
repeat 4 [
  fd 150
  right 90
]

A. A square is drawn
B. A rectangle is drawn
C. A star is drawn
D. A diamond is drawn
E. I'm not sure

```

```
9. Read these commands: (Apply to PiE-LOGO)

Define a function called square
	Repeat the following commands for 4 times
        Go forward 100 Steps        
        Turn left 90 degrees
    End the Repeat
End the function

Do the following for 12 times:
	call the function square
	turn left 30 degrees
end the repeat
  
What happend?
A. A square is drawn 12 times
B. The repeat pattern will be like a wheel
C. The side length of the square is 100
D. I am not sure
```

```
10. Followed 9, if I have a function named RandomColor which will randomly choose a color for the pen, where should I call the function if I want the color changed in every pattern? What if I want to change in every square?
```

```
11. Read these commands: (Apply to LOGO)

TO square
	REPEAT 4[
		FD 100
		LT 90
	]
END

REPEAT 12 [
	SQUARE
	LT 30
]
